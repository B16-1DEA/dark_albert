# Albert Von Dunkelheim
#### Hard Fork of the Dracula theme for Albert

_I intend to iterate upon my own dark theme to match my other display components, starting from a very popular one that is already pretty close._

_I may submit bug fixes to the upstream if I find any, but I sincerely doubt they'd be interested in my thematic changes, so those shall remain in Forksville._

_As one may surmise, the directions below reflect the state of the upstream README at the time of the initial forking. I have left them untainted._
